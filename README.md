# js-d3-demo
Demo for vanilla JS and HTML interaction + a quick intro into D3!

## Instructions
To run on your computer:
1. Open up a shell window and `cd` into cloned repo
2. Use python to set up a localhost server (my example uses python3 from anaconda installation): `python3 -m http.server 8080`
3. Navigate to `localhost:8080` on your browser

## Huge shoutout to:
- Mike Bostock for creating the D3 pkg - [d3.js](d3js.org)
- Mike Freeman for teaching me D3 during undergrad - his class material is [here](https://info474-s17.github.io/book/) and I based the scatterplot from his reusable plot example.
